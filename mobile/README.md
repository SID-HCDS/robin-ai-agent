# Robin Mobile App Starter

You can build your mobile app with:
- **Flutter** (recommended for cross-platform: iOS + Android)
- **React Native** (JavaScript/React-powered, cross-platform)
- **Android Studio** (Java/Kotlin, native Android)

## Getting Started

1. Choose your framework and install it:
   - [Flutter](https://flutter.dev/docs/get-started/install)
   - [React Native](https://reactnative.dev/docs/environment-setup)
   - [Android Studio](https://developer.android.com/studio)

2. The mobile app connects to your backend API (`/api/...`).

3. Copy the insurance flows from the web frontend (`src/App.js`) into your mobile UI.

4. For professional deployment, follow platform docs:
   - [Flutter deployment](https://docs.flutter.dev/deployment)
   - [React Native deployment](https://reactnative.dev/docs/publishing-to-app-store)
   - [Android APK release](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish)
